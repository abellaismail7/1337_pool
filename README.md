# CHEAT ALERT
This repo is just for my self. I made it public so I could access it anywhere.

I passed the pool with no cheat at all, and it was an amazing experience.

ALWAYS ASK YOUR MATES

THOSE SOLUTIONS MIGHT NOT BE VALID SOLUTIONS.

# STRATEGY
Just wait until you impatient mate make an attempt and then get traces from him/her. HAHA HAHA
